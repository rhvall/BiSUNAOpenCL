     This function is an abstraction to the calls made to OpenCL, it creates a queue, copies

     The list of parameters are as follows:
     @param dq The OpenCL dispatch queue to execute this function
     @param hostSize Integer that signals how big the hostValues array is. Ex. 'sizeof(int) * 30'
     would signal an array of 30 int elements
     @param workItems Tell OpenCL how many work items are going to be sent to the device
     @param hostValues Pointer to the memory section that contains the values and later is
     again to return the results of the computation
     @param f openCLKernelCall function pointer to be executed inside a GCL queue and will run the OCL kernel
